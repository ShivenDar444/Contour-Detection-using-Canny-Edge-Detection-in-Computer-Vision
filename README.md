# Contour-Detection-using-Canny-Edge-Detection-in-Computer-Vision


This project uses Canny edge detection to detect contours of objects in images. The Canny edge detection algorithm is a popular edge detection technique that is widely used in computer vision and image processing applications. In this project, we implement the Canny edge detection algorithm using the OpenCV library in Python.

Requirements
To run this project, we need the following:

Python 3.7 or higher
OpenCV 4.5.3 or higher


You can install OpenCV using the following command:

pip install opencv-python

Usage
To run the project, simply execute the canny_edge_detection.py script using Python:

python canny_edge_detection.py

The script will prompt one to enter the path to the image file you want to process. Once you enter the path, the script will read the image, perform Canny edge detection, and display the original image and the edge-detected image side by side.
